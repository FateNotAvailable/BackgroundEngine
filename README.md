## Supported Games

- [x] Valorant
- [ ] CS2

Feel free to request support for additional games by submitting an issue or contributing to the project.

## Additional info

Background Engine runs in background, this is because some games like VALORANT check file integrity on start, so it removes the custom background. Background engine checks if it was removed and re-inserts it again.

Video audio doesn't work.
